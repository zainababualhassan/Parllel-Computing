# Parllel-Computing
The following to files shows the sequencially and processing the the data using SIMD which a class of parallel conputing(vectors).
The results were furitful when we comapre our sequential code with the code made in parallel , the tine was inhanced by 22.8%.
I am sure that the code be ehnaced better by enhancing the code.
