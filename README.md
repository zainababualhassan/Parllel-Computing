# Parllel-Computing
The code was written in python programming language. The code uses two for loops to perform some calculations and print the image. The code could be enhanced if we could replace the loops by some mathimatical calcutions that perform  the tasks directly. This could be done if we made the code work  parralelly not sequentially. 
The  two files shows the sequential way of processing  the data and  the enhanced version of the code using  SIMD [which is a class of parallel computing(vectors)]. We used vectors in code to  perform the calclations(numpy in python) which is  how we applied SIMD in processing the data.
The results were furitful when we compare our sequential code with the code made in parallel , the time was inhanced by 22.8%.
I am sure that the code speed could be better enhanced and we will then compare it with the built in functions (thread) in pyhton. The code could be also written in cython which is a python language which uses the C language features which could also boost the speed of calculations.
