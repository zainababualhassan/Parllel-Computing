# Parllel-Computing
The code was written in python programming language. The code uses two for loops to perform some calculations and print the image. The code could be enhanced if we could replace the loops by some mathimatical calcutions that perform do the tasks directly. This coud be done if we made the code work in parralel not sequentially. 
The following two files shows the sequential way of processing  the data and  the enhanced version of the code using  SIMD [which is a class of parallel conputing(vectors)].
The results were furitful when we compare our sequential code with the code made in parallel , the time was inhanced by 22.8%.
I am sure that the code speed could be better by enhanced and we will then compare it with the built in functions (thread) in pyhton. The code could be also written in cython which is a python language which uses the C language features.
